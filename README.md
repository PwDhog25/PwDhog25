-  Hi, I’m @PwDhog25

-  I’m interested in becoming well learned on the coding/decoding messages and programs aspect

-  I’m currently learning the basics on this as I'm playing with termux/tasker right now

-  I’m looking to collaborate on how interesting and constructive language can be transferred

-  How to reach me is through this site or by email. Please help this lost soul. I'm trying to figure things out just through my (2021 borneo)MOTO G POWER Android phone.
 
 I could use --help and a few pointers please. 
                       ✌️ Thanks guys ✌️
